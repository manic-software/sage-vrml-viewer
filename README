Introduction
------------

SAGE reads VRML files generated by geant4 and displays what it finds there.

Installation
------------

If you're using windows or mac, i suggest downloading a pre-compiled version since building on these systems is more of a thing.  I also provide pre-compiled versions for one kind of linux or another on request.  Otherwise


make install

Will compile and install to $HOME
The executable goes to $HOME/bin and no other files are needed.
To install to a different location:
make install prefix=/some/dir

QT
--

The code is designed to build against either qt version 3 or version 4.
By default it build for whaveter version is the default on your system.
In order to do so, it requires the qt development libraries.  
These are standard, and tend to come in packages called qt4-devel, libqt4-devel, qt3-devel qt-devel.  Any one of these should do.
It's possible that you system has more than one.  You can find out which version is the default by running
moc -v
