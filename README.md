# sage-vrml-viewer
See A Geant Event is a vrml2 file viewer optimised for use with the geant4 simulation toolkit (although it should work with generic vrml2 files)

I developed this software a few years back.  Finally getting round to sharing it.
Probably most useful those using geant4, but may find a wider home (perhaps with some revisions)

It's a QT3/4 gui.  I use it on Linux (rhel6) and mac, although it does work on Windows.  I'll put together a windows binary distribution if there's interest.  It should work on any linux distribution with minor (if any) modifications.
