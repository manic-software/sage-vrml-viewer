# sage-vrml-viewer
See A Geant Event is a vrml2 file viewer optimised for use with the geant4 simulation toolkit (although it should work with generic vrml2 files)

I developed this software a few years back.  Finally getting round to sharing it.
Probably most useful those using geant4, but may find a wider home (perhaps with some revisions)

It's a QT4 gui, but it can be built against QT3.  I use it on Linux (rhel6) and mac.  I've also put together a windows installer.  It should build on any Linux distribution with minor (if any) modifications.
