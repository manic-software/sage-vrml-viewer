# sage-vrml-viewer
See A Geant Event is a vrml2 file viewer optimised for use with the geant4 simulation toolkit (although it should work with generic vrml2 files)

I developed this software a few years back.  Finally getting round to sharing it.
Probably most useful those using geant4, but may find a wider home (perhaps with some revisions)
